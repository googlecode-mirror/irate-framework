Irate Framework v3.1.2
=========================================
3.1.2 features a newly scripted installation method, even though it
may seem the same on the front end, it's scripted completely different
on the back end for easy implementation of future updates. This version
also comes with automatic mobile recognition script. You can easily use
this in the template files by simply using:

{if $is_mobile}Do mobile stuff here{/if}

Or you can use the following in the php script:

if($irfw->mobile->check())
{
    //Do Mobile Stuff here
}

A little more work has been done on optimizing the modulator system, and
has been implemented into the irfw core rather than being included on
it's own. This will create a more optimized load time.

I am deciding on adding a new IRFW Control panel that will specialize in
altering the database information, rather than trying to edit modules
within it.


How to install:
=========================================
Upload contents of HTDOCS to your server and
follow the following steps.

1. Go to http://your_upload_directory/irfw_install/install.php
2. Follow the steps
3. Hit Finish and you're done! (Depending on CHMOD, you may have to delete it yourself).
